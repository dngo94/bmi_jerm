## OVERVIEW
This application acts as a digital tracker for a userâ€™s health to calculate body mass index (BMI), as well as a food calorie checker. Users will be able to enter their age, height, and weight. By inputting their age, height, and weight, the website will calculate their BMI so that the user can have a better idea of their health and body type. Their BMI will be displayed and will let the user know if they are in the underweight, healthy, or overweight range. With the BMI, the user can also search up the amount of calories for certain foods.

## INSPIRATION
